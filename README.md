# lazytrivy

> **Note**
> It's functional and not too ugly, but I'd stay away from the code till I've refactored it :-D

lazytrivy is a wrapper for [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) that allows you to run Trivy without
remembering the command arguments.

The idea was very heavily inspired by the superb tools from [Jesse Duffield](https://github.com/jesseduffield) (
lazydocker, lazynpm, lazygit)
